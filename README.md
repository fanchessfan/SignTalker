# SignTalker

System Requirements:

SignTalker requires Windows OS to work. 

How to use:

First download the code as a folder. Then, open the folder and unzip ffmpeg. 
Drag ffmpeg out of the zip and into the SignTalker folder. To run the application, run runSignTalker.bat. 
Windows defender might say that the file is unsafe, but click run anyway and the app will start working.
Command prompt will then pop out. It will take 1-2 minutes to process the file and add sign-language captions. 
After it is done, a video with Gavin Newsom alongside a sign-language avatar will automatically open.

Dll issues:
